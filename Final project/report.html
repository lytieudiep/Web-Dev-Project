            <h3>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site, and what type of structure did you choose to implement?
            </h3>
            <p>My website is the website for Chicago Art community magazine, where people can find useful information about Chicago’s art culture 
                (fine art and illustration for particular). 
                Chicago is one of the biggest cities in the United States and well known as the Capitol of Art (beside New York). 
                Every year, we have around a thousand exhibitions and art events in Chicago, and a hundred art students graduated. 
                Chicago Art Magazine will be the place to introduce the new artists, new artworks, 
                and information about the exhibitions to the art lovers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose the Hierarchy structure for my website. Hierarchy structure is the most common web structure that can contain a large amount of data. 
                The hierarchy model is similar to the tree with a homepage and branches out to categories and pages. In my opinion, t
                his structure will be the most helpful for the Magazine website or News websites in general.

        <h3>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers etc. 
        </h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firstly, my background is Graphic Designer freelancer. I have to explore many sources to find inspiration, and the magazine Communication Art from the UK is one of my favorites magazines. Communication Art helps the young and unwell-known artists can show up their artwork to the world. Plus the beautiful layout and high-quality print paper, CA is the best place to feature young talents. 
                </li>
                <li>Secondly, Dribbbe.com is the website that helps me determine my website’s style. Dribbble is the social media platform where artists, especially web designers, UI/UX designers, or graphic designers, use as their portfolio. So we can explore and update the most trending style with Dribbble. 
                </li>
                <li>Lastly, I found an art agency on Dribbble that makes me feel so inspired, and they are Tubik: https://tubikstudio.com/. Tubik’s blog helps me avoid mistakes when creating the website and gives me a lot of advice to improve the style, structure, and UX</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible. </h3>
        <ul>
        <li> Colors are chosen carefully to make sure the site contrasts well so that people can easily distinguish the various elements on the page.</li>
        <li> Page is structured well with headers and in-page navigation. I also just use one h1 tag for each page followed by subheadings h2 and h3. On the other hand, I also use alt text on content to enhance the image. </li>
        <li> Clear form design: I make sure the form is designed clearly and each field is labeled well</li>
        </ul>   
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site. </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Effectiveness: make sure the users can get the art information when they access my website using a clear understanding of the user’s goals design. On the other hand, I also try to keep content consistent and avoid disruptions, such as pops-up or log-in.
                </li>
                <li>Efficiency: users can easily perform the task, such as fill out the form, looking for images or information without any disruption. 
                </li>
                <li>Engagement: make sure the proper fonts, images, colors, icons, contrasts, whitespace so that the website not only be aesthetic but also clear and logical hierarchy. The website is also responsive (able to work on a mobile screen) and interactive with the users.</li>
            </ul>
        
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Firstly, I’ve learned how to create animation on my website by using CSS @keyframe. There are two parts on my website that use animation. The first one is the animating numbers on the home page. I’ve looked up on Google and then read the instruction from https://codepen.io/shivasurya/pen/FatiB. The source code is exact, and I just need to fix some lines to implement it for my code. The second one is the moving cards on the main page. In this animation, I use the reference code from w3school.com. W3school has an example code, and I have to understand it then change the x,y measurement to make the cards move up in 4s. 
            </li>
            <li>Secondly, I’ve learned how to create carousel images on the main page using CSS and Javascript. I also knew it from w3shcool from their example. But I have to change the Javascript code to adapt with three main cards on my home page (instead of just hero image as their reference).
            </li>
            <li>Lastly, I’ve learned how to improve the UI and UX design. The knowledge I get from interactiondesign.com and Skillshare’s instructors. That information helps me creating the best layout and design and also interactive.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h3>
        <p>The best things I’ve done for this project that the web layout and web design. In my opinion, I chose the correct structure and landing page for the web magazine and the trending style for the style. 
            The color and fonts are also clean and energetic, a good fit for the artsy magazine. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, I think I’ve worked hard on HTML and CSS. To create the five different pages (including the form page), I have to do a lot of research about HTML’s tags, attributes, classes, id, etc. Adopting all that code to a trending style requires a lot of work on CSS and design experience.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?
        </h3>
        <p>If I have more time for my website, I would learn more about using Javascript to make more dynamic website. Even though I added Handlebars.js and Javascript, I think some aspects of my website can look more interactive, such as the Subscription Form, the Workshop cart. I want to add the form events, so anytime people submit it without filling in enough required information, it can show up the alert. On the other hand, the user can add the workshop course to the cart, and it will update the correct date and price on the checkout form. </p>
